### React Redux CRUD Application

This project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with React and Redux. It allows users to perform basic operations on a list of tasks.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/vAAAmsi/curdclaimzippy

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    cd curdclaimzippy

3. Install dependencies:
    npm install

4. Start the development server:
    npm start

5. Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

### Features

1. Create: Add new tasks.
2. Read: View the list of tasks.
3. Update: Edit the details of existing tasks.
4. Delete: Remove a particular task from the tasks.

### Project Structure

/src
    components       # we have a reusable Topbar component
    models           # add model and view model
    pages            # React components  
    redux-store      # Actions, Redux Reducers and Redux store configuration  
    utils            # Useful reusable components                               
    App.js           # Main application component
    index.js         # Entry point

### Technologies Used

    React
    Redux
    React Router
    Chakra UI
    Other dependencies(sweetalert2 etc..)

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
